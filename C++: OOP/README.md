# Object-Oriented Programming

**Year:** 1 <br />
**Semester:** 2 <br />
**Prerequisite:** Computer Programming <br />
**Description:** This course introduces the key concepts of object-oriented programming including objects and classes, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritances, polymorphism, as well as exception handling. Rather than the syntax of a particular programming language, the course emphasizes on how to think in term of objects. Students need to analyze program specifications and identify appropriate classes and objects. Additional programming topics include basic UML modelling such as class diagram and object diagram, principles of object-oriented design, and design patterns.
