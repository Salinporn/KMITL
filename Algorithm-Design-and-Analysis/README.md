# Algorithm Design and Analysis

**Year:** 2 <br />
**Semester:** 2 <br />
**Prerequisite:** Data Structures and Algorithms <br />
**Description:** This course provides a study of theories and techniques of algorithm design and analysis. For algorithm design, students will study a wide range of algorithmic solutions to problems from various application areas, including searching, sorting, optimization, and important problems in graph theory. In addition, important design paradigms will be covered including greedy methods, divide-and-conquer methods, dynamic programming, backtracking, and branch-and-bound methods. For algorithm analysis, students will practice analyzing the execution time and the resource consumption of algorithms, and related mathematical techniques.
